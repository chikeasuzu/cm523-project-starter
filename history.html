            <p>Haute Couture's first steps can be traced by to Charles Frederick Worth back in 1858.
               He founded the first true Couture House at number 7, rue de la Paix in Paris.</p>

                <p>Regular couture, on the other hand, refers to high-end fashion that is made in small 
                    quantities, but not necessarily custom-made for individual clients. While regular 
                    couture may still be made with high-quality materials and using traditional sewing 
                    techniques, the process is less time-consuming and expensive than haute couture. 
                    The main difference between haute couture and regular couture is that haute couture 
                    designs are made to measure and created specifically for individual clients.</p>

                <p> Meanwhile, regular couture is made in small quantities and sold to a broader customer base. 
                    Haute couture is typically more exclusive and expensive than regular couture, with prices 
                    that can easily reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. Regular couture is still 
                    considered luxury fashion, but it is more accessible to a wider range of customers.</p>

                <p>One of Schiaparelli's most significant contributions to haute couture was her 
                    introduction of surrealist elements into fashion design. She was the first designer 
                    to collaborate with artists in this way, working with Dali to create a number of 
                    iconic pieces, including the "Lobster Dress" and the "Tears Dress". These designs were 
                    considered shocking and groundbreaking at the time, as they challenged traditional ideas of 
                    beauty and femininity.</p>
                <p>In addition to her collaboration with Dali, Schiaparelli also made other significant contributions 
                    to fashion design. She was one of the first designers to incorporate zippers into women's clothing, 
                    and she also popularized the use of shoulder pads in jackets and coats. She was known for her use of 
                    bold, bright colors, and she created many iconic designs using pink, which became known as "Schiaparelli pink". </P>
                <p>Schiaparelli's impact on haute couture was significant not only because of her innovative designs but also 
                    because she paved the way for future collaborations between fashion designers and artists. She was a 
                    trailblazer in the fashion industry and a true visionary, whose influence can still be seen in contemporary 
                    fashion design today.</p></div>

                <p>One of Valentino's most significant contributions to haute couture was his use of luxurious fabrics 
                    and attention to detail. He was known for his meticulous craftsmanship, and his designs were always 
                    beautifully tailored and expertly executed. He also became known for his use of bold, vibrant colors, 
                    which were a departure from the more muted tones that were popular in the 1960s.</p>
                <p>Valentino's designs were popular with celebrities and high society, and he became known as the "couturier 
                    of choice" for many famous women, including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, and Audrey Hepburn. 
                    He continued to design for his fashion house until his retirement in 2008, and his legacy has continued to 
                    influence contemporary haute couture. </P>
                <p>Together, Valentino and Giammetti created a fashion empire that has had a lasting impact on the world of 
                    haute couture. Their designs have been worn by some of the most influential and stylish women of the 20th 
                    and 21st centuries, and their legacy continues to inspire and influence contemporary fashion 
                    designers today.</p></div>

                <p>One of Dior's most significant contributions to haute couture was his creation of the "New Look" silhouette. 
                    This was a departure from the more austere styles that had been popular during World War II, and it featured 
                    a full, voluminous skirt and a narrow waist. The New Look was a sensation when it was introduced, and it quickly 
                    became the defining silhouette of the post-war era.</p>
                <p>Dior was also known for his use of luxurious fabrics and his attention to detail. 
                    He was meticulous in his craftsmanship, and his designs were always beautifully tailored and 
                    expertly executed. He also helped to popularize a number of styles and trends, including the A-line 
                    silhouette, the H-line silhouette, and the trapeze dress. </P>
                <p>In addition to his contributions to fashion design, Dior was also a pioneer in the business of 
                    haute couture. He was one of the first designers to establish a global brand, and he expanded 
                    his fashion house into a range of other products, including perfume, cosmetics, and accessories. 
                    He was also a savvy marketer, and he created a number of innovative advertising campaigns that 
                    helped to establish his brand as one of the most influential in the world.
